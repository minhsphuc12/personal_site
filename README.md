This guide will walk you through the process of creating your personal website, from setting up the source code to publishing it on the web.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Install a text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom)
2. Install Git for version control
3. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one

## Step 2: Create the Source Code

1. Create a new directory for your project
2. Initialize a Git repository in the project folder
3. Create the basic structure of your website:
   - `index.html` (main page)
   - `css/styles.css` (for styling)
   - `js/main.js` (for any JavaScript functionality)
   - `images/` (folder for storing images)

## Step 3: Develop Your Content

1. Design your website layout
2. Write your HTML content in `index.html`
3. Style your website using CSS in `styles.css`
4. Add any necessary JavaScript functionality in `main.js`
5. Optimize images and other media for web use

## Step 4: Test Your Website Locally

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Test all links, forms, and interactive elements
3. Ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes

## Step 5: Version Control

1. Add your files to Git: `git add .`
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
3. Create a new repository on GitHub
4. Push your local repository to GitHub

## Step 6: Choose a Hosting Platform

1. Select a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
2. For GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to the "Pages" section
   - Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`)

## Step 7: Deploy Your Website

1. For GitHub Pages, your site will be automatically deployed
2. For other platforms, follow their specific deployment instructions

## Step 8: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Purchase a domain name from a domain registrar
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your hosting platform
3. Add the custom domain in your hosting platform settings

## Step 9: Maintain and Update Your Website

1. Regularly update your content
2. Keep your dependencies and libraries up to date
3. Monitor your website's performance and make improvements as needed

Congratulations! You now have a personal website up and running. Remember to continually improve and update your site to keep it relevant and engaging.
